\title{Get gene and SNP index for each region}
\usage{
index_regions(pvarfs, exprvarfs, regionfile, down_sample_ratio = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{regionfile}{Has three columns, chr, start, end}

\item{down_sample_ratio}{A scalar in (0,1]. The proportion of SNPs
left after down sampling.}
}
\value{
A list. Items correspond to each pvarf/exprvarf. Each Item is
 also a list, the items in this list are for each region.
}
\description{
For each region, get the index for snp and gene (index
is location/column number in .pgen file or .expr file) located within
this region.
}
